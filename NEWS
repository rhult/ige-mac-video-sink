===========

This release improves behavior when resizing the output widget while
playing a video. Details:

* Use the global GDK lock to protect all gtk_ calls done from other
  threads than the main thread

* Only redraw the frame when resizing if the video is paused

* Update test-sink to include fullscreen mode (by pressing 'f') and
  quit when Escape is pressed
